Custom Powershell scrips for PRTG custom EXE/XML sensors

## PRTG-Get-Joan-Status

If you are owner of [JOAN devices](https://getjoan.com/products/) and use your own on-premise management server, this script may come in handy :)
Script does return state, baterry level, temperature and wifi signal level of the device as PRTG custom EXE/XML sensor.
